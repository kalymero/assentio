Introduction
============

This is the Assentio project, a minimal lightwight blog based on Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/).
It starts as pet project with no particular features and it's not intended to be the new-wordpress-like platform.

Useful developer rule: Eat your own food!

so I started my personal blog on this code. You can see it in action here: http://antoniosagliocco.com

Feel free to contribute if you think it can be suitable to your needs.

You can check the early stage roadmap here (ehy man, the project has just started!): https://github.com/kalymero/assentio/wiki/Roadmap

Blog layout is very simple, wrote by scratch using the new twitter bootstrap 2.1.0, based on the Twenty Eleven (http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/) wordpress theme i like.

Of course you can change it to your needs, the structure is very simple. There's only one < 100 rows css file (beside bootstrap.css) and only one <20 rows js file.

You can install it in a virtualenv.

I used zc.buildout (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout) to fit environment/deployment issues.

You can found the buildout package and some install instructions here: http://github.com/kalymero/assentio_buildout

Feel free to contact me for any question.

Enjoy!
